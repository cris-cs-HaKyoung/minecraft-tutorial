      <h1>How to play?</h1>
      <p>When we play Minecraft we need to know what key we need to press to move eat run or more.
        So, we have to press 'w' to walk forward, 's' to walk backward, 'a' to walk to the left side, and 'd' to walk right side.
        You can press ctrl(control) to run. Also, if you want to swim you can press ctrl(control).
